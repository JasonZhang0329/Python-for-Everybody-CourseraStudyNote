10.2 Write a program to read through the mbox-short.txt and figure out the distribution by hour of the day for each of the messages. You can pull the hour out from the 'From ' line by finding the time and then splitting the string a second time using a colon.

Once you have accumulated the counts for each hour, print out the counts, sorted by hour as shown below.




filename = "mbox-short.txt"
hour_counts = {}

# Open the file
with open(filename, 'r') as file:
    # Read line by line
    for line in file:
        # Check if the line starts with 'From '
        if line.startswith('From '):
            # Split the line into words
            words = line.split()
            # Get the time part and split it by ':'
            time_parts = words[5].split(':')
            # Extract the hour
            hour = time_parts[0]
            # Update the count for this hour
            hour_counts[hour] = hour_counts.get(hour, 0) + 1

# Sort the hour counts by hour
sorted_hour_counts = sorted(hour_counts.items())

# Print the hour counts
for hour, count in sorted_hour_counts:
    print(hour, count)
